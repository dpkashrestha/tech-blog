## Description 

Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies.

This project is a CMS-style blog site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.
